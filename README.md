### Hi there 👋

I'm Ash

As you are here, I am guessing we both like to do some sort of coding!

My go to language is R, and (for now) my repositories will mostly be R based.

My main interests currently lie in:
 + 💧 analysing various streams of environmental data, particularly data in the water quality arena
 + 📚 helping people quickly understand data through automation and visualisation  
 + 📦 the [`{ddspWQ}`](https://github.com/a-jone5/ddspWQ) package to access open data
 + ✨ building apps in [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

I have recently developed a passing interest in web development so I am currently learning bits and pieces about
 + ☕ JavaScript
 + 3️⃣ D3.js
 + 🟠 Svelte

More to follow soon!

👋
